  description: |
    This is the date of the visit (ie time point of survey administration)
    after shifting by a random number 182 days before or 182 days after the actual
    visit date. The shifting is done on the individual level which retains the time
    interval between visits (and allows calculations of days between time points
    or other date fields which are shifted by the same number of days). To avoid
    issues with type conversion errors, the date is of type integer
